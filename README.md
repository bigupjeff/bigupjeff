### 👋 Hi, I’m @bigupjeff

I don't find existing among you easy, so coding allows me to create my own world without the restriction of 'norms' and opinions. I often build things which fail practically, but allow me to explore ideas to exhaustion. This is how I get my creative fill while learning dev 'the hard way'. I rarely learn by being told how things work, I need to **wreck** them to learn the limits, then work backward.

### 👀 I’m interested in ...

Progressive culture, aggresively rejecting regressive culture, and music that changes you every time you listen.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

 - How to live.
 - React.
 - How to shake the clunkiness out of WordPress.

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

 - life?
 - Nothing tbh, kinda on a solo mission, but my mind is always open.
